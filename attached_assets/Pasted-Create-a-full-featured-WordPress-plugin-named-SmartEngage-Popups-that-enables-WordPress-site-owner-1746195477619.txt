Create a full-featured WordPress plugin named ‚ÄúSmartEngage Popups‚Äù that enables WordPress site owners to design and deploy intelligent, behavior-based popups. This plugin should support two popup types:
	‚Ä¢	Slide-in Popups (bottom-right, bottom-left, or center)
	‚Ä¢	Full-screen Overlays

Each popup can contain:
	‚Ä¢	A title
	‚Ä¢	Body text
	‚Ä¢	An image (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Optional CTA button(s)

Plugin Features:

‚úÖ Popup Builder Interface (WP Admin)
	‚Ä¢	Custom post type: smartengage_popup
	‚Ä¢	Meta box or custom Gutenberg block to:
	‚Ä¢	Set title, text, and image
	‚Ä¢	Choose layout (slide-in vs full-screen)
	‚Ä¢	Configure button text + link
	‚Ä¢	Choose popup position (for slide-ins)
	‚Ä¢	Upload image
	‚Ä¢	Enable/disable popup

üéØ Trigger Conditions

Popups can be triggered based on:
	‚Ä¢	Number of page views per user (use cookies or localStorage)
	‚Ä¢	Time on page (X seconds)
	‚Ä¢	Scroll depth (e.g. 30%, 60%, 90%)
	‚Ä¢	Exit intent detection
	‚Ä¢	Specific URL paths or post types
	‚Ä¢	Logged-in vs logged-out users

Allow site owners to combine multiple conditions using AND/OR logic.

üîÅ Frequency Rules
	‚Ä¢	Show once per session
	‚Ä¢	Show every X days
	‚Ä¢	Show every page load
	‚Ä¢	Limit popup to max X impressions per user

üß† Targeting Options
	‚Ä¢	Device type (desktop vs mobile)
	‚Ä¢	Referrer URL (e.g., only show to users coming from Facebook)
	‚Ä¢	Cookie-based targeting (e.g., show only if a certain cookie is present)
	‚Ä¢	User role (admin, subscriber, etc.)

üìà Analytics Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Track views, clicks, and conversion rates per popup
	‚Ä¢	Store data in a custom table or use existing postmeta
	‚Ä¢	Show sparkline graphs in admin dashboard

üí° Exit Intent Detection
	‚Ä¢	Implement with mouseleave event for desktop
	‚Ä¢	For mobile, use scroll-up detection at page bottom as proxy

üõ†Ô∏è Front-End Implementation
	‚Ä¢	Use minimal JS (enqueue it properly with wp_enqueue_script)
	‚Ä¢	Popups should animate in smoothly (slide or fade)
	‚Ä¢	Use ARIA and keyboard navigation for accessibility
	‚Ä¢	Load CSS only when needed

üîê Code Quality
	‚Ä¢	Follow WordPress plugin coding standards
	‚Ä¢	Use nonces and sanitization on all form fields
	‚Ä¢	Use admin_enqueue_scripts, add_meta_box, register_post_type, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Namespace all functions or use class-based structure

üì¶ Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	smartengage-popups.php (main plugin file with header)
	‚Ä¢	/admin/ folder for all admin panel code
	‚Ä¢	/assets/ for JS and CSS
	‚Ä¢	/includes/ for core logic
	‚Ä¢	Fully localized (use __() and _e())

‚∏ª

Make sure this plugin is installable via ZIP and fully functional out of the box. It should not depend on any third-party popup or marketing library. Use vanilla JS and PHP. Prioritize performance and a clean, intuitive admin experience.
